# MTech Blueprint Editor

In development by [MTech](https://discord.gg/6axwPFyPbp).

## Introduction

This is a flowchart-based logic editor for [Scrap Mechanic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/387990/Scrap_Mechanic).
It is designed to have a shallow learning curve, but still be powerful enough to create and debug complex logic effectively.

## Features (planned + implemented)

- [ ] Basic flowchart editor
- [ ] Exporting to Scrap Mechanic
- [ ] Simulation of logic
- [ ] Logic debugging (e.g. step-by-step simulation)
- [ ] Automatic logic simplification
- [ ] Automatic logic generation
- [ ] Logic analysis (e.g. update delay/stabilization time)
